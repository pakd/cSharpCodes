# Exlanation: .NET Framework vs .NET Core vs .NET Standard
Microsoft's .NET ecosystem has evolved significantly since its inception, giving rise to three major components: .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET Standard. Each serves a different purpose in the software development lifecycle.

## üî∑ .NET Framework
Introduced in 2002, the .NET Framework is a Windows-only development platform used to build rich desktop applications (WinForms, WPF), ASP.NET web applications, and enterprise solutions. It provides a mature and stable environment but is tightly coupled with the Windows OS. While it's still supported (latest version: 4.8), Microsoft no longer adds major features, making it more suited for legacy applications.

## üü¢ .NET Core
Released in 2016, .NET Core was designed to be a cross-platform, high-performance, and modular version of .NET. Unlike the full framework, .NET Core supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, and it is open-source. It‚Äôs ideal for modern web APIs, microservices, containerized applications (e.g., Docker), and cloud-native solutions. .NET Core addressed many limitations of the original .NET Framework and became the foundation for future .NET versions.

## üìò .NET Standard
As .NET Framework and .NET Core were separate runtimes, developers needed a way to write reusable libraries that worked across both. This led to the creation of .NET Standard in 2016 ‚Äî a formal specification of APIs that any .NET implementation must support. By targeting a specific .NET Standard version (e.g., 2.0), libraries could run on .NET Framework, .NET Core, Xamarin, and others, ensuring maximum compatibility.

However, with the unification of the .NET platform starting with .NET 5 in 2020, the need for .NET Standard began to diminish. Going forward, all platforms share a single base class library, making .NET Standard obsolete for new projects.

## üåê .NET 5 and Beyond
In 2020, Microsoft released .NET 5, beginning a new era by merging .NET Core, .NET Framework, Xamarin, and others into a single unified platform simply called .NET. The idea is to support all application types (web, desktop, mobile, cloud, gaming, IoT) under a single umbrella. This transition makes development simpler and encourages developers to use .NET 6/7/8+ for all new projects.
