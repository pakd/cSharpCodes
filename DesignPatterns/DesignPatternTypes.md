- Use Creational patterns when:
    - You need control over object creation.
    - Objects need to be reused or dynamically created.

- Use Structural patterns when:
    - You need to simplify relationships between entities.
    - You want flexibility in combining objects.

- Use Behavioral patterns when:
    - You need communication between components.
    - You want to encapsulate behavior or delegate responsibility.
