# ðŸ§© MVC Pattern (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller)

The **MVC** pattern is a **software architectural pattern** that separates an application into three interconnected components. This separation helps manage complex applications by organizing code and improving maintainability.

## ðŸ”§ Components of MVC

### 1. **Model**
- Manages the **data** and **business logic**.
- Responds to requests for information and updates from the controller.
- Notifies the view of any data changes.

> **Example:** A `User` class that connects to the database and fetches user data.

---

### 2. **View**
- The **UI** or **presentation layer**.
- Displays data provided by the model.
- Sends user actions (like button clicks) to the controller.

> **Example:** HTML/CSS or a UI screen that shows user information.

---

### 3. **Controller**
- Handles **user input**.
- Interacts with the model and updates the view.
- Contains the application **control flow logic**.

> **Example:** A controller that receives a form submission, updates the database, and refreshes the UI.

## âœ… Advantages of MVC

- **Separation of concerns** (UI, data, logic)
- **Improved maintainability** and scalability
- **Easier testing** of individual components
- **Code reusability**

## ðŸ“Œ Real-World Examples

| Framework         | Language       | Follows MVC?     |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| ASP.NET MVC       | C#             | Yes              |
| Spring MVC        | Java           | Yes              |
| Ruby on Rails     | Ruby           | Yes              |
| Django            | Python         | Loosely follows  |
| Laravel           | PHP            | Yes              |

## ðŸ§  Summary

The **MVC Pattern** is a powerful way to organize code:
- `Model` â†’ Manages data and business rules
- `View` â†’ Displays information to the user
- `Controller` â†’ Responds to user input and manages interactions between Model and View
